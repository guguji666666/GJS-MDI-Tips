.SYNOPSIS
    Script to locate and remove registry entries, services, and folders associated with "Azure Advanced Threat Protection Sensor".

.DESCRIPTION
    This script performs a series of tasks to uninstall and clean up residual files and registry entries related to 
    "Azure Advanced Threat Protection Sensor". It stops and deletes associated services, removes registry entries 
    based on GUIDs found in specific registry paths, deletes cache folders and installation folders associated with the GUID, 
    and logs each action for auditing purposes.

.PARAMETER searchTerm
    The name of the application to search for in registry entries to identify related GUIDs.

.PARAMETER logFile
    Path to the log file where actions and results will be recorded.
