## 1. ‚ùå User Logon Failures

```kql
IdentityLogonEvents
//| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-05-25 00:00:00) .. datetime(2025-05-27 23:59:59))  // Filter by time range (UTC) 
| where ActionType == "LogonFailed"                      // Filter only failed logon attempts
| project Timestamp,                                      // Time when the logon attempt occurred
          AccountName,                                    // Username used in the logon attempt
          AccountDomain,                                  // Domain where the logon was attempted
          LogonType,                                      // Type of logon (e.g., interactive, remote)
          FailureReason,                                  // Description of why the logon failed
          ReportId                                        // Unique ID for correlating events
| order by Timestamp desc                                 // Show the most recent events first

## 2. üîÅ Account Lifecycle Events (Enable / Disable / Delete)

```kql
IdentityDirectoryEvents
//| where Timestamp between (datetime(2025-05-25 00:00:00) .. datetime(2025-05-27 23:59:59))  // Filter by time range (UTC) 
| where ActionType in ("Account enabled", "Account disabled", "Account Deleted changed")  // Filter for lifecycle changes
| extend AF = parse_json(AdditionalFields)                // Parse the AdditionalFields JSON for deeper info
| extend ActorAccount = AF["ACTOR.ACCOUNT"]               // Extract the actor (user who performed the action)
| project Timestamp,                                      // Time when the change occurred
          ActionType,                                     // Type of change (enable/disable/delete)

          TargetAccountDisplayName,                       // Display name of the account that was changed
          TargetDeviceName                                // Device name if related (e.g., for device accounts)
| order by Timestamp desc                                 // Sort by most recent
